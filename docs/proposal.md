## Summary
Galaga is a fixed shooter game where the user controls a starfighter, attacking and dodging enemies from above.

In this project, we will use and evaluate reinforcement learning agents capable of playing Galaga autonomously.  By using reinforcement learning algorithms, the agent will learn to move, shoot, and defend itself from the enemy in the game environment.

## Project Goals
Minimum goal: Train an agent that can successfully interact with the Galaga environemnt, correctly progress game state inputs, and perform valid actions without crashing or behaving randomly.

Realistic goal: Develop an agent that demonstrates competent gameplay by consistently avoiding enemy fire and have the ability to efficiently destroy enemies to clear up to intermediate levels.

Moonshot goal: Create an agent that exhibits expert gameplay and has adaptive strategies against different enemy patterns, and is able to clear all of the difficult levels.

## Evaluation Plan
One basic metric we will use to quantitatively evaluate our agent is through achievements in the game like levels passed, time to finish a level, and damage taken.  We can compare these statistics to our group members scores playing the game, or scores found online.  As our baseline model, we will sue a simple rule based agent and record it's scores.  We estimate the agent we implement will be significantly more accurate and understand the game logic better than the baseline.
