## Summary
Space Invaders is a fixed shooter game where the user controls a starfighter, attacking and dodging enemies from above.

In this project, we will use and evaluate reinforcement learning agents capable of playing Space Invaders autonomously.  By using reinforcement learning algorithms, the agent will learn to move, shoot, and defend itself from the enemy in the game environment.

## Project Goals
Minimum goal: Train an agent that can successfully interact with the Space Invaders environemnt, correctly progress game state inputs, and perform valid actions without crashing or behaving randomly.

Realistic goal: Develop an agent that demonstrates competent gameplay by consistently avoiding enemy fire and have the ability to efficiently destroy enemies to clear up to intermediate levels.

Moonshot goal: Create an agent that exhibits expert gameplay and has adaptive strategies against different enemy patterns, and is able to clear all of the difficult levels. 

## AI/ML Algorithms
In this project, we will start with Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a model-free reinforcement learning, as a baseline algorithm to learn a policy that maps game state observations to discrete actions such as movement and shooting. If time permits, we will explore extensions of DQN, such as Double DQN or experience replay. This will help to improve training stability and performance so that we can compare our agent against simple rule-based baseline agents.

## Evaluation Plan
One basic metric we will use to quantitatively evaluate our agent is through achievements in the game like levels passed, time to finish a level, and damage taken.  We can compare these statistics to our group members scores playing the game, or scores found online.  As our baseline model, we will use a simple rule based agent and record it's scores.  We estimate the agent we implement will be significantly more accurate and understand the game logic better than the baseline.
