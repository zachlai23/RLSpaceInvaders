## Summary

Space Invaders is a classic fixed-shooter game where the player controls a starfighter, attacking and dodging enemies from above. In this project, we will train and evaluate reinforcement learning agents capable of playing Space Invaders autonomously.

By leveraging reinforcement learning algorithms, our agent will learn to move, shoot, and defend itself from incoming enemy fire within the game environment.

## Project Goals

### 🎯 Minimum Goal
Train an agent that can successfully interact with the Space Invaders environment, correctly process game state inputs, and perform valid actions without crashing or behaving randomly.

### 🚀 Realistic Goal  
Develop an agent that demonstrates competent gameplay by consistently avoiding enemy fire and efficiently destroying enemies to clear up to intermediate levels.

### 🌙 Moonshot Goal
Create an agent that exhibits expert-level gameplay with adaptive strategies against different enemy patterns, capable of clearing all difficult levels.

## AI/ML Algorithms

We will start with **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, as our baseline. DQN learns a policy that maps game state observations to discrete actions (movement and shooting).

If time permits, we will explore extensions such as:
- Double DQN
- Experience replay mechanisms
- Other improvements to enhance training stability and performance

We will also compare our agent against simple rule-based baseline agents.

## Evaluation Plan

We will quantitatively evaluate our agent using game achievements including:
- Levels passed
- Time to complete levels
- Damage taken
- Score comparison with human players and online benchmarks

Our baseline model will be a simple rule-based agent. We expect our RL agent to significantly outperform the baseline in accuracy and game logic understanding.
